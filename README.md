- clone the repo
- create a .env file in root and fix the variables (DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASS,DATABASE_NAME)
- fix the project environment variables in application-dev to connect to database 
- run docker-compose-db
- run the project and use GrapiQL Chrome extension or whatever client to run your lovely queries
